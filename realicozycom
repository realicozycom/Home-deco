As the arrival of a newborn draws close, nursery preparations shift into high gear. Did you know that colorful crib sheets can help achieve this? According to the American Optometric Association, by three months, a baby starts to see color, and the addition of brighter, primary colors become important for their development. A baby’s color vision is fully developed between five and eight months. Colorful crib sheets can help provide visual stimuli for a developing baby. Choose patterns and colors that are bold and eye-catching, but avoid anything that could be considered too busy or overwhelming. With a little bit of planning, you can create an inviting and stimulating space for your new arrival.

What a safe crib bedding should include?
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) warns that crib bedding poses a significant danger to babies. Its recommendation: The only thing your baby needs in their crib is an appropriately-sized firm mattress and a well-fitted crib sheet.

Use infant sleep clothing and sleeping sacks instead of blankets to keep your baby warm while sleeping. Do not place crib bumpers, comforters, quilts, blankets, pillows, sleep positioners, stuffed animals, or other items in the crib with your baby. These items can block your baby’s airway and increase the risk of suffocation or strangulation. If you’re using a blanket, make sure it’s lightweight and doesn’t come up over your baby’s head.

The AAP also recommends against using products that claim to prevent SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) or improve sleep quality, such as wedges or positioners. There is no evidence that these products are effective, and some can pose serious risks to babies.

What to consider when choosing crib sheets?
Fabric
The crib sheet should be soft, breathable, and hypoallergenic. Natural fibers like cotton or bamboo are good choices. Avoid synthetic materials like polyester, which can trap heat and moisture against your baby’s skin. Most importantly, make sure the sheets fit snugly on the mattress. There should be no gaps between the mattress and the sheet, as this can create a safety hazard.

Check the care instructions before washing the sheets. Some fabrics, like bamboo, require special care to avoid damage.

Thread Count
Thread count refers to horizontal and vertical threads per square inch. Generally, the higher the thread count, the softer the sheet will become over time. For the crib sheet, the recommended thread count is 200+, and 400+ is the best.

Size
Make sure you know the dimensions of your baby’s crib before purchasing sheets. Crib sheets are available in various sizes, from mini-cribs to standard and convertible cribs.

Fitted Crib Sheet
A fitted crib sheet has elastic around the edges, which helps keep it in place. It is recommended to use a fitted crib sheet as it snugs the mattress tightly to avoid losing and entrapping your baby in order not to post any hazardous threat.
